    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      American goulash was one of my all-time favorite comfort food meals when I
      was growing up. They served it in my school cafeteria alongside a slice of
      buttered white bread and a carton of milk. This Americanized version of
      goulash was invented to stretch a small amount of beef into enough food
      for a not-so-small family. It's a simple dish that doesn't taste simple,
      so it's perfect for your weeknight dinner rotation.

    <h4>list of ingredients need for serving size of two</h4>

      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>4 pounds ground beef</li>
      <li>2 large onion, diced</li>
      <li>8 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>4 large bay leaves</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons Hungarian paprika</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 pinches cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
      <li>2 quart chicken broth or water</li>
      <li>2 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce</li>
      <li>2 cups water</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>4 cups elbow macaroni</li>
      <li>Â½ cup chopped Italian parsley</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded white Cheddar cheese (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Add ground beef and onion; cook
        and stir until beef is browned and crumbly and onion is translucent,
        about 5 minutes. Continue to cook and stir until liquid is evaporated, 3
        to 5 minutes. Add garlic, bay leaves, paprika, Italian seasoning, salt,
        black pepper, and cayenne.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors come together, about 3
        minutes. Pour in broth, marinara sauce, and diced tomatoes. Pour water
        into the sauce jar, swirl, and pour into the pot. Stir in soy sauce;
        bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until flavors
        intensify, about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a rapid simmer. Stir in
        macaroni; cook, stirring occasionally, until just barely tender, about
        12 minutes. Check for doneness after 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the heat and discard bay leaves. Stir in Cheddar and
        parsley. Cover and let rest for 5 minutes. Taste and season as desired.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Extra notes</h4>
    <p>
      Make your own Italian herb mix with a blend of oregano, thyme, rosemary,
      sage, parsley, and basil.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can use sweet Spanish paprika if you can't find Hungarian paprika. You
      can also add beans to turn this into an excellent pasta fazool.
