    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This bulgogi chicken is a quick-and-easy, but very tasty, meal. You can
      substitute the chicken with beef or pork for variety. My wife and I
      absolutely love this recipe, and it only takes 30 minutes with very few
      dirty dishes! Serve over rice.

    <h4>list of ingredients need for serving size of two</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Â½ cup chopped onion</li>
      <li>10 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon cayenne</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into thin strips</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Directions</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk onion, soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, sesame oil, sesame seeds,
        cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl until marinade
        is smooth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook and stir chicken and marinade together in a large skillet over
        medium-high heat until chicken is cooked through, about 15 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Extra notes</h4>
    <p>You can substitute peanut oil for the sesame oil if desired.</p>
    <p>
      Add vegetables if you wish; I normally use carrot straws and sliced
      mushrooms. For a little more bite, I use a peppercorn medley grinder
      instead of black pepper.
